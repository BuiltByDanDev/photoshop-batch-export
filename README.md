# Photoshop Border Automation Script

This Photoshop script automates adding an even white border around images of varying pixel sizes, based on their aspect ratio. It resizes images to a fixed width (2160px) and adds a 30px white border on all sides. Supported aspect ratios:

-   3:2 (landscape)
-   2:3 (portrait)
-   3:4 (Instagram portrait)

## Features

-   Automatically detects image ratio and applies the correct border
-   Fixed output width of 2160px, height adjusts to maintain ratio
-   Exports final images as JPEG with quality 6
-   Creates a custom export folder inside the source folder

## Add Script to Photoshop's Scripts Menu

To make the script available under **`File > Scripts`** in Photoshop:

1. Move the script file `BatchAddWhiteBorders.jsx` to the appropriate scripts folder:

    - **Windows:**

        ```
        C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [version]\Presets\Scripts\
        ```

    - **macOS:**
        ```
        /Applications/Adobe Photoshop [version]/Presets/Scripts/
        ```

2. Restart Photoshop.

The script should appear under `File > Scripts` for quick access.

## How to Use

1. Open Photoshop and run the script.
2. Select the folder containing your images.
3. Enter a name for the export folder (it will be created inside the source folder).
4. The script processes each image, skipping those that donâ€™t match supported ratios.
5. Exported images will have even white borders and be saved as JPEG in the export folder.

## Requirements

-   Adobe Photoshop with JavaScript scripting enabled.
